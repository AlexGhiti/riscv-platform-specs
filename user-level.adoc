## User-Level Platform

* Within main-memory regions, aligned instruction fetch must be atomic, up to
  the smaller of ILEN and XLEN bits.  In particular, if an aligned 4-byte word
  is stored with the `sw` instruction, then any processor attempts to execute
  that word, the processor either fetches the newly stored word, or some previous
  value stored to that location.  (That is, the fetched instruction is not an
  unpredictable value, nor is it a hybrid of the bytes of the old and new
  values.)
