## Introduction

This document contains the RISC-V UNIX-class platform specification.  This
specification defines additional restrictions on implementations in order to
allow software to be compatible between these implementations.  These
restrictions are enumerated along with the least privileged level to which they
apply.  Implementations can be compatible with a subset of this specification,
but that subset must include all restrictions placed on a privilege level as
well as all less-privileged levels.  For example: implementations can claim to
be compatible with the "RISC-V Supervisor-Level UNIX Platform" if they are
compatible with the entire "User-Level Platform" and "Supervisor-Level
Platform" chapters of this document.
